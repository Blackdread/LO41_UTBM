LO41_UTBM
=========

Created by Yoann CAPLAIN. A very interesting project to put in practice what I learn in my LO41 course at UTBM. Use of threads, mutex, synchronization, signals, etc

Some patterns: Factory, ...

signal(SIGINT, );
signal(SIGSTOP, );
pthread_create
pthread_join
pthread_cond_broadcast
pthread_cond_signal

pthread_mutex_t
pthread_cond_t


Code is documented but in French and English.
